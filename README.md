# 🎵 Spotify Clone (Frontend Only)

Welcome to my **Spotify Clone** – a fully responsive frontend replica of the popular music streaming platform, built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project was created to sharpen my frontend development skills and explore how complex user interfaces like Spotify's can be recreated using modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Beautiful and clean UI inspired by Spotify  
- 📱 Fully responsive design for all screen sizes  
- 🎛️ Interactive play/pause buttons and hover effects  
- 🔥 Tailwind CSS used for rapid and efficient styling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** - Structuring the layout  
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling with utility-first classes  
- **JavaScript** - Adding interactivity and behavior
